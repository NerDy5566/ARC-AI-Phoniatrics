# ARC-AI-Phoniatrics
Articulation disorder is a common language problem in children, resulting in incorrect bite and unclear sentences. At present, there is no unified definition of the types of dysarthria in the medical profession in Taiwan. speech therapist must be provided in hospital treatment. After a series of pronunciation of the words, the therapist will make judgments based on the child’s pronunciation, and will continue to visit for several months to improve the pronunciation problems. This will cause the patient’s treatment cycle to be lengthened and the patient can only be treated in the hospital. We hope to automate the treatment process, use the phonetic character cards used in major hospitals as the basis for judgment, and combine the convolutional neural network in machine learning to classify several types of phonological errors and correct categories.
